# PHYS5070-Final-Project

## About the Code ##
An overview of the project is contained within a single notebook titled "final_project.ipynb". The notebook describes the mathematics used in the project and includes testing of the primary functions.

The functions written for the project are included in a separate Python module titled "photon_absorber.py". A notebook titled "example.ipynb" provides an example of loading the module and generating a photon detection signature.
